# Custom configuration file for MySQL database backup program
#
# Sample Configuration File 
#   - created by Stefan Dragnev - dragnev@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu
#   - some small mods by Danny Park - dpark@molbio.mgh.harvard.edu
#   - converted to use YAML, some small mods by Sean Quinlan - sean@quinlan.org
#
# IMPORTANT!
# This backup process requires that binary update logging is turned on.
# We recommend using both log-slow-queries and log-bin
#
# SECTIONS DESCRIPTION: 
#
#   db_connect - contains user name and password for the database server  
#
#   backup-params - controls how often and what is the max size of different
#                     log files before they are rotated	
#
#   mysqladmin - section for mysqladmin options
#
#   mysqldump - section for mysqldump options
#
#   mail-setup - controls whether email notifications will be send
#                  and to which people
#
#   backups - list of databases to be backed up give as
#                        name or as a pattern

# IMPORTANT: Even if some configuration variable has no value there
#           should be an equal sign after it regardless.  If there is
#           no equal sign the config file parser will complain and the
#           backup script will die

# IMPORTANT: Ensure that this config file is owned by mysql in daemon
#            group and its mode is 400 or 440 Each line should be in
#            the format varname = value 
#            If you want just to have a value specify it in the
#            following format varname = 

# IMPORTANT: Comments on the same line as a config varible are not supported
#            Eg:  varname = value # commment  - invalid
#
#              varname = value 
#                 # commment - valid

## db_connect ##

# for socket connections which the program will use to connect to the database 
# server with the databases which will be backed up

db_connect:
    PORT: 3306
    SOCKET: '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock'
    USER: backup
    PASSWORD: password
    RDBMS_HOST: localhost


## backup-params ##
# Specifies where the backups should be stored and how many log files
# to keep and when to delete them etc.
#
# DUMP_DIR - the directory where full database backups and binary logs
#            will be stored.
#
# LOG_FILE - the full path and the name of a file containing all messages
#            generated by the backup program
# 
# DUMP_COPIES - number of old dumps (and binary logs) to keep
#
# LOG_DIR - the path where the general, slow, error, and bin logs are kept
#
# MAX_GEN_LOG_FILES   - number of general logs which need to be kept
# MAX_SLOW_LOG_FILES  - number of slow logs which need to be kept
# MAX_ERROR_LOG_FILES - number of error logs which need to be kept
#
# MAX_GEN_LOG_SIZE - max size in MB for the general query log files
#                    before they are rotated
# MAX_SLOW_LOG_SIZE - max size in MB for the slow query log files
#                     before they are rotated
# MAX_ERROR_LOG_SIZE - max size in MB for the error log files before
#                      they are rotated
#
# CYCLE_BIN_LOGS_DAILY - mysql binary update log will be cycled with
#                        every full dump regardless.  Specify 'yes'
#                        here if you want it to also be cycled and
#                        moved to the dump_dir every day (every time
#                        the script is run) [recommended]
#
#
# All rotate_* variables accept only 'yes' or 'no' as valid values 
# 
# rotate_gen_query_logs - whether to rotate query log files
#
# rotate_slow_query_logs - whether to rotate slow query log files
#
# rotate_error_logs - whether to rotate error log files

## backup-databases ##
#
# Logs will be backed up every time the backup program is run, unless
# that activity is specifically turned off. The logs will always be
# flushed and backed up whenever the databases are backed up. This is
# not considered optional.
# We recommend running it daily.
#
# List all the databases you want to back up in the following format:
#    databases:
#        - mysql
#        - database1
#        - database2
#        - etc
#
# List all the days you want your databases backed up as well in a coma
# seperated list:
#    days: Mon,Wed,Sat
# For most sites, once a week + daily logs is sufficient
