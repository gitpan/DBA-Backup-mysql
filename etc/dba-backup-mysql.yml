# Custom configuration section for MySQL database backup program
#
# Paste this file into the dba-backup.yml to be used by your DBA::Backup
# process and edit as needed to specify your mysql servers
#
# IMPORTANT!
# This backup process requires that binary update logging is turned on.
# We recommend using both log-slow-queries and log-bin


# Name a new server to be backeup of type mysql. A good naming convention
# is probably just to use the hostname the server runs on. Copy and edit
# this entire section once per mysql server you want to back up. The name
# of the server may contain characters in the class [A-Za-z0-9_] only.
server_servername1:
  server_type: mysql

## connect ##
# Specifies the port, username, socket and the name of the temporary text file 
# for socket connections which the program will use to connect to the database 
# server with the databases which will be backed up

  connect:
    PORT: 3306
    SOCKET: '/var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock'
    USER: backup
    PASSWORD: password
    RDBMS_HOST: localhost


## backup-params ##
# Specifies where the backups should be stored and how many log files
# to keep and when to delete them etc.
#
# LOG_DIR - the path where the general, slow, error, and bin logs are kept
#
# MAX_GEN_LOG_FILES   - number of general logs which need to be kept
# MAX_SLOW_LOG_FILES  - number of slow logs which need to be kept
# MAX_ERROR_LOG_FILES - number of error logs which need to be kept
#
# MAX_GEN_LOG_SIZE - max size in MB for the general query log files
#                    before they are rotated
# MAX_SLOW_LOG_SIZE - max size in MB for the slow query log files
#                     before they are rotated
# MAX_ERROR_LOG_SIZE - max size in MB for the error log files before
#                      they are rotated
#
# CYCLE_BIN_LOGS_DAILY - mysql binary update log will be cycled with
#                        every full dump regardless.  Specify 'yes'
#                        here if you want it to also be cycled and
#                        moved to the dump_dir every day (every time
#                        the script is run) [recommended]
#
#
# All rotate_* variables accept only 'yes' or 'no' as valid values 
#
# rotate_gen_query_logs - whether to rotate query log files
#
# rotate_slow_query_logs - whether to rotate slow query log files
#
# rotate_error_logs - whether to rotate error log files

## mysqladmin ##
# list of options given directly to mysqladmin
#
# verbose - generate more verbose messages
#
# force - continue even if the is an SQL error

## mysqldump ##
# options to be given to mysqldump
# change this to use opt instead

# opt - is equivalent to all the options below

## databases ##
#
# Logs will be backed up every time the backup program is run, unless
# that activity is specifically turned off. The logs will always be
# flushed and backed up whenever the databases are backed up. This is
# not considered optional.
# We recommend running it daily.
#
# List all the databases you want to back up in the following format:
#  databases:
#    - mysql
#    - database1
#    - database2

  databases:
    - mysql

## days ##
# List all the days you want your databases backed up:
#  days:
#    - Mon
#    - Wed
#    - Sat
# For most sites, once a week + daily logs is sufficient

  days:
    - Sat


## mail-setup ##
# Overide global mail notifications for MySQL server backups.
# Copy any mail setup parameters from main conf file and set locally here.
#
#mail_setup:
#  mail_notification: yes
