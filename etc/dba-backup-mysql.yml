# Custom configuration file for MySQL database backup program
#
# IMPORTANT!
# This backup process requires that binary update logging is turned on.
# We recommend using both log-slow-queries and log-bin
#
# SECTIONS DESCRIPTION: 
#
#   backup-params - controls how often and what is the max size of different
#                     log files before they are rotated	
#
#   mysqladmin - section for mysqladmin options
#
#   mysqldump - section for mysqldump options
#
#   mail-setup - controls whether email notifications will be send
#                  and to which people
#
#   backups - list of databases to be backed up give as
#                        name or as a pattern

# IMPORTANT: Ensure that this config file is owned by an appropriate privileged
#            user and group and its mode is 400 or 440.

# IMPORTANT: Comments on the same line as a config varible are not supported
#            Eg:  varname = value # commment  - invalid
#
#              varname = value 
#              # commment - valid

## backup-databases ##
#
# Logs will be backed up every time the backup program is run, unless

#    databases:
#        - mysql

#        - etc
#
# List all the days you want your databases backed up as well in a coma
